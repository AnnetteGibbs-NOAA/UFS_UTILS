This series of consistency tests must be run before any
changes to the chgres_cube program are merged to the
main line of development.  Any test failures must
be resolved or explained before merging.

TO RUN THE CONSISTENCY TESTS (Release mode):

1) Build chgres_cube program.  Go to root directory and
   invoke 'build_all.sh' with no arguments.
2) Set the fixed directories. Go to ./fix and
   invoke the script.
3) Invoke driver script for your machine.  See script
   prolog for details.

A series of tests will run.  A test fails if the output
files differ from the baseline set of files as determined
by the 'nccmp' utility.

Log output from each test will be placed in its own
logfile - "consistency.log??".

A summary of results will be in "summary.log".

TO RUN THE CONSISTENCY TEST ON WCOSS2 IN Debug MODE:

1) Ensure fixed directories are set (see above).
2) Invoke the 'driver.debug.wcoss2.sh script.

The program will be compiled in 'Debug' model. A single 
test will run. Log output will be placed in
"consistency.debug.log01" and a summary of
results will be placed in "summary.debug.log".

DO NOT RUN THE RELEASE AND DEBUG TESTS AT THE SAME TIME.
